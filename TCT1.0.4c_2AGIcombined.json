The panic from the crowd wanes when the woman gets up with not a single singed hair. He grins wide at the looks of astonishment and the excited murmurs.",

Perhaps one toiled away in a tower, meditating on the many theories and equation he found in their books. Or perhaps one derives her power from her connection to nature or a deity. And then there are some who are merely born with arcane potential. Rarer still are those few who may perform grand arcane feats requiring great magic potential. Knowing this, one might be discouraged ever attempting to gain any semblance of arcane power for it would seem to be that magic is only harnessed by the extraordinary. Seemingly defiant of that notion, A Flickwrist is considered to be one who utilizes the lesser magics present within all in the form of their spelldance. Growing slowly in arcane ability but making up for it in utilizing it.",

It can be drawn from within through a basic grasp of the spell and controlled and swift gyrations. The translation of spell into movement, though easy for the mind, is difficult for the body to grasp. Adepts may come to realise that they are essentially speaking through motions but only masters are fluent enough to effectively express poetry through their motions as they reach a point where it is as if their body becomes capable of thinking for itself.",
