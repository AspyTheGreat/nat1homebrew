Then in a quick burst of motion, makes an elegant movement of his arm, Spinning his wrist and splays his fingers into a bystanders face as flames explode from his palm engulfing the woman's head in yellow fire. The panic from the crowd wanes when the woman gets up with not a single singed hair. He grins wide at the looks of astonishment and the excited murmurs.",

Try as they might, they just appear to be flailing their arms fruitlessly. Just as she begins to contemplate retiring the training session. Her despair lifts a little when, in the distance, she spots a bolt of fire impacting a training dummy leaving smolders.",
            "A man in strange foreign garb channels his rage into movement, controlled and serene. To his adventuring opponents he appears to be dancing but before he stops on a pose, a barrage of fire, lightning and ice seemingly erupt from his every limb, laying an elemental assault upon the inexperienced travelers.",
            "It is quite rare to find one proficient in the arcane. Though it may come from a myriad sources, the gift of magic remains to be rare in most. Perhaps one toiled away in a tower, meditating on the many theories and equation he found in their books. Or perhaps one derives her power from her connection to nature or a deity. And then there are some who are merely born with arcane potential. Rarer still are those few who may perform grand arcane feats requiring great magic potential. Knowing this, one might be discouraged ever attempting to gain any semblance of arcane power for it would seem to be that magic is only harnessed by the extraordinary. Seemingly defiant of that notion, A Flickwrist is considered to be one who utilizes the lesser magics present within all in the form of their spelldance. Growing slowly in arcane ability but making up for it in utilizing it.",

It can be drawn from within through a basic grasp of the spell and controlled and swift gyrations. The translation of spell into movement, though easy for the mind, is difficult for the body to grasp. Adepts may come to realise that they are essentially speaking through motions but only masters are fluent enough to effectively express poetry through their motions as they reach a point where it is as if their body becomes capable of thinking for itself.",
                "A Flickwrist will realize that it is not the spells that they are trying to master but their body. The energy present within is just the medium to that end. Through great dedication to their art they may achieve that and will be able to turn even this little speck of magic into a force wild and destructive in its capability."

Their life thus revolves around the seeking of new inspirations for their craft or perhaps in the quest for its perfection.",

Or perhaps they seek the chaos of battle where they may put their body to the test, seeing if it can act out of sheer instinct. Some may see nature itself as their muse and travel to distant, lurid lands to observe their environments in all its minutia from the gait of a river to the flight of a bee."

The barbarian's driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls.",

But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian stand out from all others; see the following sections for some ideas.",

But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."

Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery.",

The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.",
